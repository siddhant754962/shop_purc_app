## Overview

This web application predicts whether a shopper is **likely to make a purchase** on an e-commerce website using behavioral data. The app is built with **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface and leverages a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model trained on historical shopper behavior.

It comes with a **futuristic neon UI**, interactive input fields, random sample generator, and animated prediction cards for a visually appealing experience.

---

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to **analyze shopper behavior** and provide predictions that help e-commerce platforms:

* Identify potential buyers.
* Optimize marketing campaigns.
* Improve user experience by understanding visitor behavior patterns.

---

## Features

* Predict whether a shopper will purchase (`LIKELY` or `NOT likely`).
* Confidence score for the prediction.
* Random sample generation for quick testing.
* Interactive 3D floating input fields.
* Neon futuristic animated UI with background effects.
* Detailed explanations of each input and output field.

## Output Explanation

* **LIKELY to make a purchase:** Shopper is predicted to buy something.
* **NOT likely to make a purchase:** Shopper is predicted not to buy anything.
* **Confidence:** Probability score (0 to 1) indicating certainty of prediction.

**Visualization:**

* ‚úÖ `LIKELY` predictions appear in a green animated bomb card.
* ‚ùå `NOT likely` predictions appear in a red animated bomb card.

## Model Details & Algorithm

**Algorithm Used:** **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

* KNN is a **supervised learning algorithm**.
* It calculates **distance metrics** (like Euclidean distance) between the input sample and training data.
* It finds the **k nearest neighbors** and predicts the class based on **majority voting**.

**Why KNN:**

* Simple and easy to understand.
* Effective for small-to-medium sized tabular datasets.
* No training phase (lazy learning) makes it flexible for new data.

**Data Used for Training:**

* Number of pages visited by category.
* Time spent on each page type.
* Bounce rates and exit rates.
* Special day indicator.
* Traffic type, browser, OS, month, region, visitor type.

## Model Performance

**Accuracy:** `0.8694` (\~87%)

**Confusion Matrix:**

| Actual \ Predicted | False | True |
| ------------------ | ----- | ---- |
| **False**          | 1998  | 86   |
| **True**           | 236   | 146  |

**Classification Report:**

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| False | 0.89      | 0.96   | 0.93     | 2084    |
| True  | 0.63      | 0.38   | 0.48     | 382     |

**Averages:**

* Macro Average: Precision 0.76, Recall 0.67, F1-score 0.70
* Weighted Average: Precision 0.85, Recall 0.87, F1-score 0.86

> **Interpretation:** The model is excellent at predicting **non-purchasers** but has lower accuracy in predicting **purchasers**. To improve, consider class balancing, feature scaling, or using ensemble methods.

---

## Limitations & Future Improvements

* KNN may not scale well with very large datasets.
* Model struggles with **imbalanced classes** (more non-purchasers than purchasers).
* No feature scaling applied; this can affect distance calculations.
* Future improvements:

  * Apply **StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler** for features.
  * Tune K-value and distance metric.
  * Try **Random Forest, XGBoost, or Logistic Regression** for higher accuracy.
  * Include more behavioral or demographic features for richer prediction.
